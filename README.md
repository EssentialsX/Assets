# EssentialsX Assets

This repo contains assets for the EssentialsX project, including (but not limited to):
- EssentialsX logo designs
- Logos for spinoff subprojects under the EssentialsX project
- Graphics created for the EssentialsX [website](https://github.com/EssentialsX/Website) and [wiki](https://github.com/EssentialsX/Wiki)
- Graphics created for the EssentialsX channels on [MOSS](https://github.com/MinecraftOSS)

## SVG format

Some of the SVGs don't render correctly in browsers - you may want to use Inkscape or another tool to view them.

Note that all SVGs (except those marked as `plain`) are stored in the [Inkscape SVG format](https://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/Inkscape_SVG_vs._plain_SVG).
You can manipulate these in another editor, but **do not commit your changes to this repo**. If you do, the files will break when reopened in Inkscape and your changes outside Inkscape may be lost.

In short, use Inkscape and everything will be fine.
